I am finishing up my PhD in Mobile Network Security at Radboud University.
This project started in December 2020.
During my PhD I focused on multiple topics within (and related to) mobile network security, including testing, fake base station attacks, and privacy.
You can find my publications [here](/publications), or on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&hl=en&user=6CfkHloAAAAJ).

Before doing my PhD I completed my Master's degree in mathematics focusing on algebra and topology (resulting in this [thesis](master_thesis.pdf)).
Before that I achieved a Bachelor's degree in mathematics and computer science (with a thesis in mathematics written in Dutch, see [here](bachelor_thesis.pdf)).
Both the Bachelor's and Master's degree are from Radboud University.
